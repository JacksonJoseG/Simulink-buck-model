## Overview

This repository contains the complete analysis, modeling, and design of a digital controller for a DC-DC Buck (step-down) converter. The project spans from the mathematical derivation of the plant's transfer functions to the simulation of a realistic implementation, including a sensor, signal conditioning circuit, A/D converter, and the PID control algorithm in a simulated microcontroller.

The main objective was to design a discrete PID controller to regulate the converter's output voltage at 24V, meeting specific settling time and overshoot requirements.

## âœ¨ Key Project Stages

* **Mathematical Modeling:** Derivation of the state-space equations and continuous transfer functions ( $G_v(s)$ and $G_i(s)$ ) for the Buck converter.
* **Open-Loop Analysis:** Simulation of the plant in Simulink to characterize the step response and the voltage and current ripple.
* **Discrete Control Design:**
    * Discretization of the continuous plant using the ZOH (Zero-Order Hold) method.
    * Design of a digital PID controller using the MATLAB SISOTOOL to meet performance requirements.
    * Conversion of the designed controller into a difference equation for software implementation.
* **Realistic Simulation:** Implementation of a complete simulation model that includes:
    * A Hall effect voltage sensor (LV25-P).
    * A signal conditioning circuit with operational amplifiers.
    * Quantization of a 12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
    * The PID control algorithm implemented in a `MATLAB Function` block, simulating a microcontroller.
* **Robustness Test:** Evaluation of the controller's ability to reject disturbances in the load and input voltage.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

The project culminated in a discrete PID controller that successfully met the performance requirements.

**Discrete Controller Transfer Function:**
$C(z) = \frac{0.0413z^2 - 0.0739z + 0.0357}{z^2 - z}$

**Difference Equation for Implementation:**
$u[k] = u[k-1] + 0.0413e[k] - 0.0739e[k-1] + 0.0357e[k-2]$

**Closed-Loop System Simulink Design (Realistic Simulation):**
The final model, including the sensor and ADC, demonstrated that the controller is capable of regulating the output voltage at 24V in a stable manner.
